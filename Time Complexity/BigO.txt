Big O notation is special notation that tells you how fast an algorithm is. 

Who cares? Well, it turns out that you’ll use other people’s algorithms 
often—and when you do, it’s nice to understand how fast or slow they are.

Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.

Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation.
